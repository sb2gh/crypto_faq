CRYPTOCURRENCY PRIMER

What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is first and foremost a distributed bookkeeping ledger of historical peer-to-peer transactions. The name is derived from the fact that this ledger is constituted of a series of unchangeable transactions called blocks. Most blockchains are decentralized and open sourced. For instance, the bitcoin blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger of all transactions between peers of bitcoins since its inception. Other blockchains, such as the ethereum blockchain offer smart contracts functionality.

Decentralized?
In the context of blockchain, decentralization refers to the fact that for this distributed network (computers/servers) anyone can participate and transact on the ledger. To ensure the integrity of the ledger mechanisms are put in place such as mining and proof-of-work in the case of bitcoin.

Bitcoin?
It is a medium of exchange with finite supply. It is a digital currency in the sense that it is created and stored electronically in the bitcoin blockchain using encryption techniques.
Advantages of bitcoin?
Not controlled by central banks
Accessibility anywhere in the world
Permanent ledger
Remove third-party involvement such as banks
Pseudo-anonymity
24/7 availability
Disadvantages of bitcoin?
Still complex to acquire and keep safely
Volatility explained partially by its novelty

Where to keep it, a.k.a. Custody?
Bitcoin ownership is demonstrated through digital keys (private/public), bitcoin addresses and digital signatures. These digital keys are stored outside the blockchain by the user in what is called a Wallet. The storage can be done on one’s computer (hot wallet) or on an external drive (e.g, basic hard drive or highly secured USB storage such as the one offered by Ledger).
The complexity and security issues of self-custody has been a tremendous roadblock to bitcoin/cryptocurrencies' large public adoption. For the same reason the self-custody for companies/institutions cannot satisfy internal compliance requirements. In this environment, we saw the development of professional operators that specialize in the safety of crypto assets transfers and storage, a.k.a. Custodians.
How to buy bitcoin?
Choose a crypto trading service/exchange/broker - safety risk, hacking is common
Connect the crypto trading service to one’s bank/credit card
Place a buy order
Decide on a safe storage - hot vs cold storage? exchange? Self-custody? Professional operators?


Other cryptocurrencies?
There are over 5000 cryptocurrencies that can be divided into 9 types: exchange, stablecoins, payment, Decentralized-Finance (DeFi) tokens, utility, NFTs, and asset-backed tokens.
Exchange tokens: native to crypto exchange platforms. E.g., Binance, FTX
Stablecoins: cryptocurrencies of which the value is pegged/tied to another currency (sub-group of asset-backed tokens). E.g. Tether, USD Coin
Payment tokens: used for paying for goods and services. E.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum
Utility tokens: allow users to perform some action on a certain network in the future. E.g., Golem, Sirin Labs
DeFi token: linked to automated decentralized platforms that operate using smart contracts. E.g. Avalanche, Uniswap
NFT: non-fungible tokens - digital asset consisting of digital data stored on a blockchain (mostly on Ethereum blockchain, Solana emerging). OpenSea is the largest marketplace of NFTs.
Asset-backed tokens: digital claims on a physical asset and are backed by that asset. E.g., Pax Gold.

Future of cryptocurrencies?
Further adoptions both on the retail side and institutional/company side
Growth of DeFi with further disruption of the banking system
Implementation of more efficient - speed/energy cost - transaction validation mechanisms. Ethereum is finally on the brink of moving away from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake which should drastically increase its adoption on many projects (already #2 cryptocurrency in market capitalization).
